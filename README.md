To measure the Signal strength of Wireless Access Points using an android application.

It’s often useful to know how strong a signal a cell phone is receiving at a specific moment. We may come across scenarios where one is trying to make a call but it won’t go through to the intended recipient. Or maybe texts, emails or posts hit the inbox hours after they were sent. In cases like these knowing the signal strength in dB can help us determine why the phone didn’t get the service as expected and take action so it doesn’t happen again. It'll also help us understand the health of available Wireless Access Points and choose the best point to connect at any given instance.
